# <Refactoring-Webpage>

## Description
This webpage was built by refactoring an example code from bootcamp.  Building this helped me learn the semantic structure of html and css documents. Also fixed problems with the function of the first header button.

## Installation
Can use repository or url to view webpage

## Usage
Using class tags such as <section>, insead of individual id tags to reduce the amount of css code needed for the same funtion.  All items that function the same way can be group together with a less specific tag. The section id tag was missing from the html link for the first button in the header.  Once added, when the viewer clicks one of the header buttons the webpage transitions down to the related information bar.

## Credits
Original html and css provided by Denver Coding Boot Camp 

## Features
Button functions in header to direct viewer to element boxes in webpage
